config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	select SRCU
	select IRQ_WORK
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_BOOST

	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  This driver boosts the frequency of one or more CPUs based on
	  various events that might occur in the system. As of now, the
	  events it reacts to are:
	  - Migration of important threads from one CPU to another.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_SCHEDUTIL
	bool "'schedutil' cpufreq policy governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ && SMP
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_ATTR_SET
	select IRQ_WORK
	help
	  This governor makes decisions based on the utilization data provided
	  by the scheduler.  It sets the CPU frequency to be proportional to
	  the utilization/capacity ratio coming from the scheduler.  If the
	  utilization is frequency-invariant, the new frequency is also
	  proportional to the maximum available frequency.  If that is not the
	  case, it is proportional to the current frequency of the CPU.  The
	  frequency tipping point is at utilization/capacity equal to 80% in
	  both cases.

	  If in doubt, say N.
